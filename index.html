          The Los Andes Natural Park, a biosphere reserve, is an obligatory
          reference point for the inland Mediterranean forest and scrub, and
          habitat for native fauna and flora.

          <br />
          <br />

          It was declared a natural park in 1983, with an area of 9,090
          hectares. being one of the largest enclaves in the Valencian
          Community. With a great thickness of vegetation, and several streams
          offer an ideal climate for terrestrial and aquatic species. Its
          forests, holm oak and pine, are home to a large colony of birds.
          
          <br />
          <br />

          Among the species in the park we can highlight one of the last
          colonies of griffon vultures in the area. We will also be constantly
          flown over by the peregrine falcon or the Bonelli's eagle. As we
          approach the streams, we will see numerous footsteps of wild boar and
          deer, and if we do not make too much noise, it is not difficult to
          find some drinking under the watchful eye of the kingfisher, waiting
          for the absent-minded trout.
